      <h2>Collect your Thoughts with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jour-guided-journaling/id1439590239">Jour</a></h2>

      <p> Whether it is my lack of focus or my fear of realizing how little I got done that day, journaling has always been a difficult habit for me to get into. I have read about its benefits and how it clarifies thoughts, resolves internal issues and reduces stress. Even knowing these things, I couldn’t get myself to do it. Until one day, I was scrolling through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> and saw an article titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/throw-out-your-diary-jour-is-a-new-app-for-digital-journaling/"> Throw away your diary, Jour is a new app for guided journaling”</a>. It captured my interest and, therefore, my attention for 15 seconds. The article checked two major boxes I didn’t know I had: guidance, and security. I realized that the issue’s I was having with journaling was partially due to the lack of instruction. Nobody was prompting me when to reflect or what to say. This is something people usually don’t want but it was necessary for this situation. Jour, not only reminds me to write every day/night at the time I scheduled but asks me questions that get me started. I have been using Jour for 3 months and I can honestly say it has improved my quality of life. I am sure there are other apps like this but Jour is my app of choice for now.</p>

      <h2>1st Blog Post</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Cole Gendelman, July 23, 2019.</h5>

      <p> As a software engineer, I get a lot of questions about where to learn to program. I figured this would be a great starting point for my blog. This post will be less of a life hack and more of a list of useful resources.</p>
      <p> First, I would suggest you watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440 ">video</a> from [TEDxSMU] about why you should program. It provides a funny take on why you should start in the first place.</p>
      <p> The resources I provide might are different than the ones Christian Genco provides in the video but I linked to his <a href="https://christian.gen.co/">website</a> just in case you want to perspectives.</p>
      <p> So, there many different types of languages and choosing one feels like a big responsibility. I promise you it is not. Once you learn how to code in one language, you develop code logic skills that make it MUCH easier to transition to other languages.</p>
      <p> Here a <a href="https://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/development/best-programming-language-to-learn-first/">link</a> with descriptions of each language and reasons why you would learn each. </p>

      <p>  Now that you are motivated and know which language or set of languages (impressive) you want to learn, I have a provided list of FREE resources below which have a link and a short description of their value (in my opinion).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston/playlists">The New Boston</a> - A hilarious Youtube channel with tutorials on everything from C++ to Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp.org</a> - An really great website that provides over 2000 of guided tutorials</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">Kahn Academy</a> - I am sure everyone has heard of this but they are a great place to start coding</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all">Code Academy</a> - They do have a premium edition but you do not need it to learn the basics.</li>
        </ul>
